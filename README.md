## Description

This is my personal website. It is written in Go and displays an aptitude for
creating streamlined, usable, and most of all, well maintained websites. It uses
a custom written engine to dynamically create project pages based on my own
GitHub repositories.

It also contains a very basic blog engine (though that feature was very quickly
assembled, so I feel as though it may not be the best example of my aptitude).
All in all, I believe this project demonstrates my competence in Go, along with
my general ability to develop and style websites.
