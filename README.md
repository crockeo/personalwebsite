## Description

This is my personal website. It is written in Go and displays an aptitude for
creating streamlined, usable, and most of all, well maintained websites. It uses
a custom written engine to dynamically create project pages based on my own
GitHub repositories.

It is also planned to include configuration files so that in the event one would
want to adopt this engine for their own use, it would simply be a matter of
configuring a set of files. Thus I believe, this project also displays an
affinity towards reusable code.
